## DESCRIPTION:

The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a full-stack web application designed to enable multiple users to edit a shared document simultaneously from different devices and locations. This project replicates the functionality of popular tools like Google Docs, focusing on real-time synchronization, intuitive formatting, and seamless collaboration.

The core technologies used include **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **Quill.js** for rich text editing, **Socket.IO** for real-time communication, **Node.js** and **Express.js** for backend logic, and **MongoDB** for persistent data storage. These tools work together to create a responsive, scalable, and interactive platform that supports concurrent editing with minimal latency.

This editor is ideal for remote teams, educational institutions, and content creators who need to collaborate on documents in real time. It supports live cursor tracking, autosave, document versioning, and basic authentication. The UI is built with responsive design principles, ensuring accessibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The scope of this project includes:
- Real-time document editing and formatting
- Multi-user collaboration with conflict resolution
- Backend data persistence and retrieval
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements
- Integration with cloud services and user roles (optional)

Through this internship, I gained hands-on experience in building real-time applications, managing asynchronous data flow, and deploying full-stack solutions. I learned how to structure codebases for maintainability, handle socket events efficiently, and design user-friendly interfaces.

I sincerely thank **Codtech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. The mentorship and guidance provided by **Neela Santosh Kumar** helped me understand the practical aspects of web development and real-time systems. This experience has significantly boosted my confidence and technical skills, preparing me for future collaborative and professional development.
